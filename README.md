# Agent for Identifying Top 1% AI-Focused VC Firms

This project builds an autonomous agent that scrapes public web data, extracts AI-related investment information, and ranks the top 1% venture capital firms actively investing in artificial intelligence. The agent uses Google search APIs, spaCy for NLP, and Flan-T5 for classifying investment snippets into actual vs projected categories. It intelligently filters, cleans, and ranks real funding activity across firms.

ðŸ“„ To explore how the agent works, download and open the `ipynb` file locally or in Google Colab. It contains the full pipeline logic, including scraping, NLP classification, entity extraction, and ranking.

ðŸ“Š The `csv` file is the output generated by the agent after extracting and processing the web data. It includes confirmed AI investments, associated VC firms, and standardized funding amounts.
